      description: Pokémon are the creatures that inhabit the world of the Pokémon games. They can be caught using Pokéballs and trained by battling with other Pokémon. Each Pokémon belongs to a specific species but may take on a variant which makes it differ from other Pokémon of the same species, such as base stats, available abilities and typings. See Bulbapedia for greater detail.
